# CodingSample
Coding sample for job applications

This coding sample is the final project for Tim Duy's January - March 2022 EC 522 Economic Forecasting class. The assignment was to forecast Oregon's total non-farm payroll (FRED id: ORNA) over the 2022 - 2023 period. The assignment was to use an ARIMA model and the RATS forecasting program; I also performed additional analysis in R using some of the machine learning techniques from Ed Rubin's EC 524 Econometrics class.

The final project report is included in this repository as Bishop_FinalProject.pdf and can be considered a writing sample. Appendix A of the report is the write-up describing the results of my machine learning forecasts. The R code used to produce those results is included in the R folder of this repository.

For anyone interested in a RATS coding sample, the RATS input is included in Appendix B of the final project report.
